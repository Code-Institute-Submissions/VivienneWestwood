<h2>Vivienne Westwood Website</h2>

I've designed this website for my first Milestone project for the User Centric Frontend Development module.
This website has been created for fans and enthusiasts of Dame Vivienne Westwood. 
There is colour and flair to reflect Vivienne's persona. It touches on Vivienne's self-created empire, interviews, photos, life history and present day.
Vivienn Westwood is an iconic dress designer/maker and a political activist. She has soared to her iconic status and recognition through her working years, particularly through the punk rock era.
From the above, Vivienne has amassed a huge following of fans. Vivienne still makes appearances at political rallies and some interviews.
This website is a little reflection of Vivienne's success.
The aim of this website is to provide a user-friendly platform for users and fans to enjoy.
